# Old and optional

If you want the instructions
```
instructions=(
    I have in my head, a random (whole) number
that is greater than or equal to 0
but LESS THAN 2048.
Your job is to guess my number.
Each time you guess, I will tell you if 
 my number is at least as big as
 your guess.
For example, if my number if 42:
   * and if you guess 100, I will say:
     NOT THAT BIG!
   * if you guess 30, I will say:
     AT LEAST THAT BIG
   * if you guess 42, I will say:
    AT LEAST THAT BIG
Once you think you know the answer,
instead of guessing, type "final"
...
Then hit enter, and type your guess.
If you're right, you win!
If you're wrong, I win!
